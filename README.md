# Z1 Music App üé∂

I love music too ü•Å! So I want to share with all Z1 team my particular version of this music application. Come in, **enjoy my code and your fav tunes**!

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è To start

It is time you could hear your fav tunes. I suggest you two essay ways to do it: 

-  Star by **cloning or downloading this project**. Remember to execute this commands in your terminal before start: 

```bash
  yarn && yarn dev
```

Z1 Music App is now running at http://localhost:3000!

- Or go to the live demo here: [Z1 Music App](http://music-app-psi.vercel.app/)

<br>

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è LogBook

<br>
I go into this project in which, for ten days, it will be my second home. My first goal is to know everything releated with this project: technologies, architecture and, of course, what are the features I have to be involved in ü§ñ. My main mission is just to add value to this Music app but without losing its initial essence. 

<br>

**Schedule my work ‚è≥Ô∏è**

So, once I have got started with the project, it's time to schedule my work. I use `Jira` on a daily basis, but in this case since I'm the only developer on the team at the moment, I have decided to use `Trello`. 
- You can see [here](https://trello.com/invite/b/LgfxRqdy/ATTI5cfd25af1bf88a9c4a7b901dbddeafa4C6C29852/music-app-planning) what is the progress of my application.

I expect that when you read these lines, all the tasks will be on the Done list.
I am using a `Kanban methodology` because I think it is the best option to organize my tasks on my own and reach to the deadline üèÅ.

<br>

**Deploy Z1 Music App üåç**

My following task is to deploy my project so that the user is able to use the app.
As you will see in this logbook, I have preferred to do the tasks related with infrastructure and structure first. This helps me with the project set up before I start with the code. 

As a deployment method, I have choosen `Vercel` instead of `Github pages` or another similar platform because of the advantages of this technology. With `Vercel`, for example: 
- I can preview my site in every push since it build a unique URL for every commit and PR.

- or I can generate rollbacks to any version, but without the need to revert commits or data changes.

**Config commit linter ‚¨ÜÔ∏è**

Getting a clean code is the goal of every developer, but it is so important, as well, to have a clean git log. Commits rules help to improve teamwork and make sense as a unit to your commit messages. So, I have decided to use `CommitLint` and `Husky` to linting my commits. 

[`Conventional commits`](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) help us to follow certain rules in your commits. If we try to make a commit that does not follow the convention we have chosen, it will fail. Meanwhile, [`Husky`](https://typicode.github.io/husky/#/) is a git hooks to execute rules when we add a commit message.

**CI with Github Actions üöÄ**

For me it is really significant to have a clean code and a working application without any bugs or error/warning messages. In addition to using git hooks before each commit, I find it very necessary to check the code on each PR automatically. With this objective, `Continuous Integration` with [`Github Actions`](https://github.com/features/actions) allows me to meet minimum quality standard. For example, run test or linter before merging each branch.

**E2E testing: Cypress üìù**

I have decided to introduce e2e testing  because this kind of testing ensure the app is ready for launch with the security that appearance and behaviour work properly and there is any bug. In addition, I have worked previously with this technology, so I feel more comfortable on it. 

In this implementation I have had some issues regarding on execute e2e testing on ci workflow. Basically, I was looking for any solution and I found in the following resource the library `start-server-and-test`.
